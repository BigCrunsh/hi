[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BigCrunsh/hi.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BigCrunsh/hi)

This is a place for small experiments and excercises. Currently:

- analysis: contains notebook answering random questions
- projects:
	- Play around with longest common subsequences (in [go](https://golang.org))
	- notebook extraction for better readability and testatibility
